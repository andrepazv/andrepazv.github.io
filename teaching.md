<strong><span style="color: #993366">Teaching & Mentoring</span></strong>  
  
  I believe exchanging knowledge is key to succesful science and such an exchange can happen in different ways. In addition to teaching university courses I try to get involved in the mentoring of students at different levels including high school and undergraduate students as well as graduate students visiting our lab.
