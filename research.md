Welcome to my research page! This page is under construction so thank you for your patience :-)!  

  
  
My main research right now is focused on patterns of neotropical diversity and their environmental correlates and the phylogeography of neotropical amphibians. I had in the However,I am generally interested in spatially explicit research and I love interdisciplinary research so I am or have been involved in projects spanning from the study of deforestation drivers to the distribution of tropical diseases. Here is a small summary of some of those projects. If you want to know more don't hesitate to send me an email! 

Mapping diversity patterns in the neotropics and understanding their environmental correlates

Phylogeography of Neotropical Amphibians: traits, climate and geography as drivers of genetic diversity

<strong>DNA Barcoding in the neotropics and potential applications<\strong>

Although I am not currently working on this I did for a few years and would love to go back to it. This project included using DNA barcode data for phylogeography applications [to pub] and for identification of fauna in illegal traffic seizures [link]. Within this project I also published a review of DNA barcoding uses in Spanish [GET] and a comparison of species id accuracy using different methods.  
  
  
<strong>Distribution and climate correlates of tropical diseases<\strong>
<img style="float: right;" src="/images/web_tropicaldis.jpg" height="200"> I love maps and models so I have been involved in different collaborative projects led by the amazing [Camila Gonzalez](https://cimpat.uniandes.edu.co){:target="_blank"} at Universidad de los Andes in Colombia using spatially explicit sampling designs, ecological niche modeling and others to understand the distribution and climate drivers of tropical diseases, their vectors and causing agents.
