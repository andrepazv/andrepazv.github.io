<ul>I am broadly interested in the patterns of species distributions and the processes behind the generation and persistence of those
 patterns. For my PhD I am currently studying how environments can be used to predict different dimensions
 of diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. I am also involved with several projects studying how environments can be used for biodiversity 
 prediction in the Neotropics (see my research page for more info).
 <br>
 I graduated with a BS in Biology from Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia where I studied the phylogeography 
 of the Red-eyed tree frog and how the environment may be influencing the phylogeographic patterns. During my Master´s at the 
 same university I studied the environmental and ecological determinants of population genetic divergence in amphibians of
 Panama. I was awarded a Fulbright Colombia fellowship and I am currently a Biology PhD student in the Ecology Evolution and Behavior subprogram at CUNY. I joined the program and
 the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org">Carnaval Lab</a> in the Fall 2015.
