I am interested in the patterns of species distributions and the processes behind the generation and persistence of those
 patterns. I graduated with a BS in Biology from Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia where I studied the phylogeography 
 of the Red-eyed tree frog and how the environment may be influencing the phylogeographic patterns. During my Master´s at the 
 same university I studied the environmental and ecological determinants of population genetic divergence in amphibians of
 Panama. I am now hoping to integrate phylogeography, species distribution models and physiological aspects of organisms 
 to understand species range limits (using frogs as a model). For this I was awarded a Fulbright Colombia fellowship and
 I am currently a Biology PhD student in the Ecology Evolution and Behavior subprogram at CUNY. I joined the program and
 the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org">Carnaval Lab</a> in the Fall 2015.

This site is under construction! In the meantime here is a picture of my favorite ecosystem, the Paramo.
