<para> I am broadly interested in the patterns of species distributions and the processes behind the generation and persistence of those
 patterns. Currently, I am particularly interested in how remote sensing can be incorporated in biodiversity research to improve
 our understanding of the relation between environments and diversity and hopefully help us imporve biodiversity monitoring.
 For my PhD I am studying how environments can be used to predict different dimensions of diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic
 Forest. Although I work with diverse groups of organisms I have a particular interest in amphibians and I am also involved 
 with several projects related to amphibian phylogeography and understanding amphibian responses to climate change (see my research page for more info).

  I graduated with a BS in Biology from Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia where I studied the phylogeography 
 of the Red-eyed tree frog and how the environment may be influencing the phylogeographic patterns. During my Master´s at the 
 same university I studied the environmental and ecological determinants of population genetic divergence in amphibians of
 Panama. I was awarded a Fulbright Colombia fellowship and I am currently a Biology PhD student in the Ecology Evolution and Behavior subprogram at CUNY. I joined the program and
 the <a href="http://www.carnavallab.org">Carnaval Lab</a> in the Fall 2015.
